    "emotion_analysis": "Upon reviewing the situation, I assess that the customer's emotional state is currently FRUSTRATED and possibly ANNOYED due to the malfunctioning communication application. The customer is likely feeling helpless and unsure of what steps to take to resolve the issue.\n\nThe customer's language (\"не работает приложение связи, что мне делать, к кому мне обращаться?\") also indicates a sense of urgency and impatience, which further supports my assessment that they are experiencing negative emotions.\n\nHowever, I am pleased to see that the customer is reaching out for help, which suggests that they are not feeling completely overwhelmed or despairing. The tone of their message appears to be more pleading than angry, indicating an openness to finding a solution.\n\nTo effectively address these emotional cues, I will prioritize empathy and understanding in my response. I will acknowledge the customer's frustration and apologize for any inconvenience caused by the app malfunction. I will then offer clear, concise guidance on steps they can take to resolve the issue, including troubleshooting tips and recommendations for reaching out to MTS technical support.\n\nBy acknowledging and addressing the customer's emotional state, I aim to create a sense of calm and trust, which will facilitate a more productive and successful resolution of their issue."
